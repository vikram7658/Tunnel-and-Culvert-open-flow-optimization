# Tunnel-and-Culvert-open-flow-optimization
When designing non-pressurized tunnels or culverts using Manning's equation, this Python script with an optimization library helps determine the optimal width and height. It allows control over velocity and discharge by applying constraints based on hydraulic requirements, ensuring efficient and reliable design.
